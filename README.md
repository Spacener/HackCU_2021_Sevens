# HackCU_2021_Sevens
Repository for HackCU in Spring of 2021, team Sevens.

#Attributions
Icons were created by the wonderful folks at The Noun Project! The people icon was created by Prime Icons, US. The satellite icon was created by ProSymbols, US. The telescope icon was created by Icons Producer. Furthermore, our satellite image came from Geely. Finally, big thanks to tsparticles, Bootstrap, socket.io, node.js, and express for making our project possible

# Inspiration
A collective interest in astronomy prompted us to consider how many artificial objects, in reality, obscure our Milky Way. They interfere with stargazing, muck-up science observations from the surface, and leave streaks on images.

# What it does
Satalight offers a suite of accurate and updated graphics describing the positions artificial satellites currently in our sky. You can gather how many objects are above you, realize the impact, and rationalize the severity of our light pollution pandemic.

# How we built it
We hosted this site on Heroku, using node.js, HTML and Bootstrap, Express.js, CSS, and the Plotly and particle.js libraries. We gathered our satellite data using the N2YO API.

# Challenges we ran into
Plotting the satellite data was a major task. Laying out this data on our app, making it presentable, and fully utilizing Bootstrap were also considerably difficult.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our site's visualizations are on point! Having such a polished product is also quite gratifying.

# What we learned
We learned many things about many new libraries and coding languages. The Plotly library, node.js, Express.js, advanced Bootstrap, CSS, and even a particle generator in node.js were all topics we explored this hackathon. We all also became quite familiar with using and formatting data from an API, for massive data collection. Most of all, we acknowledged the power of friendship.

# What's next for Satalight
This website will continue to run for any and all curious souls. Our message stands. We intend to continue to use this site as a means to shine light on satellites and artificial light pollution in-orbit.
